3.0
---
	- Do not resubmit when initial submit is still ongoing (resubmit were never taken)
	- Ignore non existing batch output when cleaning
	- Server can save and load batches (json format)
	- Performance improvement for EOS: cache directory content for test. Check existence
		of output file in the cache instead of always looking in EOS. The cache expires
		after 1 minute.
	- Batch summary is send directly to client when connecting instead of waiting for
		the next monitor.
	- Use timeout for client calls from server to avoid blocking it completely when client
		has disconnected in the mean time.
	- Use timeout for bsub subprocess command.
