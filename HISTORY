	- Add job grouping feature. New fields in config file:
		 jobsGrouping: grouping factor
	  New $-parameters:
		 fileName (formal signification changes): first file of the input list
		 fileNameArr[n]: nth file of the input list
		 fileList: full list of input files separated by \n
	- Add --limit option that sets an upper limit for the number of jobs concurrently
		in a RUN or PEND state. Not a hard limit as there is a delay between submission
		and monitoring.

	- Do not resubmit when initial submit is still ongoing (resubmit were never taken)
	- Ignore non existing batch output when cleaning
	- Server can save and load batches (json format)
	- Performance improvement for EOS: cache directory content for test. Check existence
		of output file in the cache instead of always looking in EOS. The cache expires
		after 1 minute.
	- Batch summary is send directly to client when connecting instead of waiting for
		the next monitor.
	- Use timeout for client calls from server to avoid blocking it completely when client
		has disconnected in the mean time.
	- Use timeout for bsub subprocess command.
